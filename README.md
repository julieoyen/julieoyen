## Hello there, I'm Julie Øyen! 👋

I'm a Front End Developer student based in Oslo, passionate about web development and UX. I love creating and contributing to innovative projects that are user-friendly, accessible, and visually appealing.

### About Me 👩🏽‍💻

I'm currently studying at Noroff and have just finished my first year. Next year, I'll continue my studies at Noroff and start my UX journey with online learning at Gokstad Akademiet. I aim to complete both programs by June 2025. This summer, I'll be working as a coding teacher at a kids' code camp at Schibsted, and in the fall, I'll be volunteering at a coding camp for girls, called TENK tech camp.

My journey in technology and UX began in my childhood, inspired by watching startups like Facebook and Instagram grow. I was always thrilled by new updates and features, especially improvements in the user experience. This early fascination has driven me to pursue a career where I can combine creativity with technology.
